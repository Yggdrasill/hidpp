# HID++ message format

  The HID++ message format is a series of bytes, either 7 or 20 bytes in length.
  When a message is sent or received, the first 4 bytes are metadata, followed
  by 3 or 16 bytes of data.

  --- Byte 0 describes the type of message. Either 0x10 (short) or 0x11 (long),
      7 or 20 bytes respectively.

  --- Byte 1 is the device index. This can be 0xFF for a wired device or a
      Logitech Unifying transceiver. If the device connected by such a
      transceiver wirelessly, the device index is 1-6.

  --- Byte 2 is the command. These can be register reads/writes, LED state
      reads/writes, DPI configuration reads/writes etc.

  --- Byte 3 is an address, register or a particular request. For HID++ 2.0
      this would be a particular function call for the feature/command specified
      in byte 2.

  These 4 bytes are followed by the command arguments, or if the device is
  sending to the host device, the data.
